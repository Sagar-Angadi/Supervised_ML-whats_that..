This repo contains the implementation of Supervised ML Algorithm on the  Unlocking Market Insights Post-COVID-19 Lockdown.

What is a Supervised ML Algorithm?
In supervised machine learning, algorithms learn from labeled training data, and their goal is to make predictions or classify new, unseen data. The term "supervised" comes from the idea that the process involves a teacher or supervisor who provides guidance to the algorithm during training. The training dataset consists of input-output pairs, where the algorithm learns to map inputs to corresponding outputs.

You will find the details of the project in a seperate notepad file in the repository.
